     (PartialMomentumBalance.firstOrder_dps_K, y_start = 0, T = 0.01 s), so initializing at rated
     flow states that the loop carries 168 kg/s while three quarters of its resistance does not
     exist. That is not a steady state: the loop initializes some 55 % high and the missing
     216 kPa then has to appear within one 0.01 s time constant against an algebraic momentum
     balance, which the integrator does not survive. At zero flow the form losses genuinely are
     zero, so y_start = 0 is correct there and the null transient brings the loop up to rated
     before the trip - which is also what the experiment describes. See

<h4>What is being checked</h4>
<p>Adding 15 parallel branches to a closed loop introduces failure modes that do not announce
themselves: a branch can reverse, the split can drift, the loop can fail to close, and the
model will still integrate and produce plausible looking reactivity curves. This model runs the
primary system at rated pump speed and asserts the things that must hold if the hydraulics are
solved correctly.</p>

<h4>Which of these are verification and which are calibration</h4>
<p>Checks 1 and 3 to 5 are verification in the strict sense: they compare the solution against
something that must be true of any correct solution, and no input can be chosen to make a
failure go away. Check 2 tests a calibration against the number it was calibrated to, which is
weaker but still catches the common failure of editing one volume in isolation. Check 6 is a
calibration check and is therefore only a warning: the form losses are estimates, and the value
they were tuned to is the rated point itself.</p>

<h4>Status</h4>
<p>Not yet run. No Modelica compiler was available in the environment where this model was
written, so the tolerances above are stated acceptance criteria, not observed results.</p>

<p><code>tol_flowSplit</code> and <code>tol_massBalance</code> are set two orders of magnitude
above the solver tolerance of 1e-6 rather than at it, because the rings are not quite exactly
symmetric even here: the radial peaking factors give each ring a slightly different power, so
at 100 W the rings differ in temperature by something like 0.4 microkelvin, which through the
viscosity biases the split by about 1e-9. That is far below either tolerance, so what these two
numbers actually have to sit above is solver noise, not physics.</p>

<p>Check 6 is the one that may genuinely fail on first run: it compares the delivered flow
against the rated point, and the loop form losses have never been exercised against the pump
characteristic in a solver. It is a warning for that reason.</p>
