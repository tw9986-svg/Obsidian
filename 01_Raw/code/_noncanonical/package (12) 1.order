<h4>Why the core needs its own closure</h4>
<p>The MSRE fuel channels are <b>laminar at rated flow</b>. At 168 kg/s through
1140 channels of 2.875244e-4 m2, the bulk velocity is 0.2333 m/s and</p>
<p><code>Re = m_flow*Dh/(A_total*mu) = 168*0.015851/(0.327778*1.0002e-2) = <b>812</b></code></p>
<p>so the core never enters the range Gnielinski is defined for, under any condition this
library simulates. Reaching Re = 2300 would need 476 kg/s, 2.8 times the rated flow. The heat
exchanger is a different matter - both its sides run at Re of order 1e4 - which is why it keeps
the plain Gnielinski closure
<a href=\"modelica://MSRE.ClosureRelations.Nus_MoltenSalt\">Nus_MoltenSalt</a> and the core
uses this one.</p>

<p>The blend weight and its first derivative both vanish at each end of the window, so the
Nusselt number is continuously differentiable across it. There is <b>no multiplier, no
enhancement factor and no Nusselt floor</b> anywhere in this model: the laminar branch is a
constant because fully developed laminar duct flow has a constant Nusselt number, not because
a value was needed to make a result come out.</p>

<p>The MSRE core sits at <code>Re = 812</code>, <code>Pr = 20.1</code>, so only the laminar
branch is ever exercised there. The Gnielinski branch is retained so that the model stays
usable if a future case runs the core turbulent, and so that core and heat exchanger reduce to
the same expression where both are valid.</p>

<h4>Fully developed versus developing flow - the assumption that matters most</h4>
<p><code>Nu = 4.36</code> is the <b>fully developed</b> value. At MSRE core conditions the flow
is fully developed hydrodynamically but <b>not</b> thermally:</p>
<table border=\"1\">
<tr><th>Quantity</th><th>Value</th><th>Against the 1.6256 m channel</th></tr>
<tr><td>hydrodynamic entry length <code>0.05*Re*Dh</code></td><td>0.644 m</td>
    <td>channel is 2.5 entry lengths - hydrodynamically developed over most of its length</td></tr>
<tr><td>thermal entry length <code>0.05*Re*Pr*Dh</code></td><td><b>12.94 m</b></td>
    <td>channel is <b>12.6 %</b> of it - thermally developing over its <b>entire</b> length</td></tr>
<tr><td>Graetz number <code>(Dh/L)*Re*Pr</code></td><td>159</td>
    <td>entrance-dominated</td></tr>
</table>
<p><b>What the table above is, and is not.</b> <code>0.05*Re*Dh</code> and
<code>0.05*Re*Pr*Dh</code> are the conventional laminar entry-length estimates for a
<b>circular</b> duct with a simple wall boundary condition and no volumetric heating. The MSRE
fuel channel is none of those things, so these numbers are a <b>screening metric for the
thermal-development assumption</b> - they say the fully developed assumption should not be taken
for granted - and they are <b>not</b> the actual thermal entrance length of the MSRE channel.</p>

<p><b>The sign of the resulting error is NOT established here.</b> An earlier version of this
documentation said 4.36 was a <q>lower bound with a known sign</q> and that using it was the
<q>conservative</q> choice. That claim was withdrawn: it borrows the classical entrance-region
result, which is derived for a circular duct with either a constant wall temperature or a
constant wall heat flux and <b>no</b> volumetric heating in either the fluid or the wall. This
problem has volumetric heating in <b>both</b> the salt and the graphite, conjugate conduction
through the graphite, and a wall condition that is neither constant temperature nor constant
flux but the outcome of the coupled solution. Under those conditions the classical entrance
solutions do not establish which way the true Nusselt number departs from 4.36, so no direction
and no bound is claimed. <code>Nu = 4.36</code> is used here as a <b>baseline fully developed
laminar approximation</b>, and quantifying the departure is deferred work, not a settled sign.</p>

<h4>Transitional region</h4>
<p>Neither branch is valid over <code>2300 &lt; Re &lt; 3000</code> and no transitional
correlation is claimed. The smoothstep blend is a <b>numerical interpolation</b> between the
two branches, chosen so that <code>Nu</code> and <code>dNu/dRe</code> are continuous and the
solver sees no event, not a physical model of transition. Any result that spends time in that
window should be treated as unresolved.</p>

<h4>Provenance of the laminar constant</h4>
<pre>
ASSUMPTION / GENERIC LAMINAR CLOSURE
Used only as an interim closure for the 1-D TRANSFORM benchmark model.
Not an experimentally validated MSRE-specific heat-transfer correlation.
</pre>
<p><code>Nu_laminar = 4.36</code> is the fully developed laminar value for a <b>circular</b>
duct at <b>constant wall heat flux</b>; 3.66 is the corresponding constant-wall-temperature
value. The constant-heat-flux value is used because that is what the graphite boundary in
<a href=\"modelica://MSRE.Components.CoreChannel\">CoreChannel</a> actually imposes: the
graphite annulus is adiabatic on its outer radius and on both ends, and its only internal
source is the <code>f_graphiteHeating</code> share of the fission power, so whatever it
generates must leave through the salt interface. The wall therefore sets a flux, not a
temperature. With the default <code>f_graphiteHeating = 0</code> that flux is zero in steady
state and the choice does not matter; it matters in transients and in the paper's
graphite-heating sensitivity case.</p>

<p><b>This constant is not MSRE-specific and is not claimed to be.</b> The real channel is an
obround 3.048 x 1.016 cm with a 0.508 cm corner radius - since the radius is exactly half the
short dimension, the two ends are semicircular - and a duct of that shape has a laminar Nusselt
number of its own, distinguishably different from the circular 4.36. Correcting for it is
deliberately deferred:</p>

<tr><th>Stage</th><th>Treatment</th></tr>
<tr><td>current implementation</td><td>generic laminar closure, this model</td></tr>
<tr><td>future refinement</td><td>thermal entrance-region correction (Graetz/Hausen); the channel is only 12.6 % of the thermal entry length</td></tr>
<tr><td>future refinement</td><td>geometry-dependent rectangular/obround laminar correlation</td></tr>
<tr><td>future refinement</td><td>ORNL/MSRE-specific heat-transfer treatment</td></tr>
<tr><td>future refinement</td><td>Poppendiek effect and graphite-fuel coupling</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>What this does and does not affect</h4>
<p>It sets the fuel-to-graphite temperature difference and hence the graphite temperature. It
does <b>not</b> enter the core bulk energy balance: the fission power reaches the salt as a
volumetric source in each axial control volume
(<code>CoreChannel.pipe.InternalHeatGen</code>, fed by
<code>ReactorCore.Qs_channels = Qs_core*(1 - f_graphiteHeating)</code>), not through this
closure, so the core outlet temperature, the core delta-T and <code>Q_core</code> follow from
<code>Q = m_flow*cp*dT</code> independently of any Nusselt number.</p>
