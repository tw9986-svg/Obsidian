<h4>Active density baseline</h4>
<p><b>ACTIVE verification density: Cantor / ORNL-TM-2316</b>, read from
<a href=\"modelica://MSRE.Media.FuelSalt.Utilities.d_T\">FuelSalt.Utilities.d_T</a>, which is
the same function the fuel salt medium itself uses. The Compere and pre-Phase-2 correlations
are retained here only for reference comparison and provenance tracking; no assertion and no
active result depends on them. The current transit-time mismatch is attributed to the
unresolved partial geometry baseline and must not be corrected by changing the density model
or the assertion tolerances.</p>

<h4>The question this answers</h4>
<p>Jeong et al. (2026) do not publish the fuel salt properties their MARS model used, so the
density cannot be compared directly. It can be compared indirectly.</p>

<p>A transit time multiplied by a mass flow rate is a <b>mass</b>, with no density in it. The
reported <code>tau_C = 9.56 s</code> at 168 kg/s therefore states that the MARS core holds
<b>1606 kg</b> of fuel salt, whatever correlation produced it. Divide that by a core volume
taken from documented hardware and the result is the density MARS must have been using.</p>

<table border=\"1\">
<tr><th>Core volume used</th><th>Implied density</th><th>vs Cantor 2196.5</th>
    <th>vs Compere 2249.3</th><th>vs legacy 2063.1</th></tr>
<tr><td>1140 channels of ORNL/INL cross-section, 1.6256 m (<b>this library</b>)</td>
    <td><b>3014.2 kg/m3</b></td><td><b>+37.2 %</b></td><td>+34.0 %</td><td>+46.1 %</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.4315 m2 x 1.6406 m (Mao Table 2, retired)</td>
    <td>2268.7 kg/m3</td><td>+3.3 %</td><td>+0.9 %</td><td>+10.0 %</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>What that table says now, and what it used to say</h4>
<p>Read the second row alone and the implied density lands within a few percent of the
published correlations, which is what this model was written to show. Read the first row and it
does not: 1606 kg cannot fit in 1140 channels of documented cross-section at any plausible
MSRE fuel-salt density. The difference between the two rows is entirely the flow area - Mao's
0.4315 m2 against the 0.32778 m2 that 1140 channels of 1.2 x 0.4 in with 0.2 in rounded corners
actually add up to.</p>

<p>Since the core geometry was rebuilt from the hardware dimensions, the first row is the
active one. The conclusion has therefore inverted: this is no longer evidence about which
density correlation MARS used, it is evidence that <b>the MARS core node is not the fuel
channels alone</b>. Either the plena are much larger than this record assumes or MARS counts
salt as core that this record counts as plenum and downcomer. See
<a href=\"modelica://MSRE.Data.Geometry\">Data.Geometry</a>, open item O-12.</p>

<p><code>tau = rho*V/m_flow</code>: the benchmark states a <b>mass</b> flow rate, so this model
is genuinely density dependent and switching the baseline moves every row. The gap to the paper
is now +3.3 % on the core side and +8.6 % on the loop side, against a 2.3 % spread between the
two density correlations, so <b>the residual mismatch is not a Compere-versus-Cantor
question</b>. It also should not be read as agreement: the core row is that close because the
two core-boundary nodes are assumed to be equal-volume thirds of the referenced plenum totals,
which is an assumption and not a measurement. See
<a href=\"modelica://MSRE.Data.Geometry\">Data.Geometry</a>, open item O-12B.</p>

<h4>Why this is not circular</h4>
<p>Nothing here uses a volume that was calibrated against a transit time. The channel volume is
1140 channels of documented bore and length. The core mass comes from the reported transit time
and the reported flow rate. The only assumption is that the MARS core is mostly its fuel
channels, which is exactly the assumption the first row of the table now calls into
question.</p>

<p>The loop side is different and no assertion is made about it. <code>V_loop</code> in this
library was never independent until Phase 5: <code>V_downcomer</code> had been set to absorb
the balance of the inventory. It is now the vessel annulus, but <code>L_downcomer</code>,
<code>V_pumpBowl</code> and the pipe lengths remain assumptions, so the loop row is weaker
evidence than the core row.</p>

<h4>Status of the assertions</h4>
<p>Both are parameter-time and need no solver.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first <b>fails</b>: 37.2 % against a 5 % tolerance. This is
<code>EXPECTED_MISMATCH_DURING_PARTIAL_GEOMETRY_BASELINE</code>. It failed at 34.0 % before the
density baseline was unified, so unifying it did not cause the failure and does not cure it.
The tolerance has deliberately not been widened - see open item O-14.</li>
<li>The second <b>holds</b>: 37.2 % against 46.1 %.</li>
</ul>
