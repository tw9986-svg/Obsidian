  /* The pump transients solve the momentum balance DYNAMICALLY, unlike the steady models.

     Two reasons, and the first is physical. The loop's effective inertia length is
     sum(L_i/A_i) = 1314 1/m, dominated by the three 5-inch pipes, so accelerating the loop from
     rest to 166.5 kg/s under the pump's 300 kPa takes m_flow*L_eff/dp = 0.73 s. That is not
     negligible against the 4 s shaft time constant of a 10 s startup, and an algebraic momentum
     balance discards it entirely.

     The second is that a stagnant loop is DEGENERATE under an algebraic momentum balance. With
     the pump off, isothermal and elevation closed, sum(dp) = 0 is satisfied identically at zero
     flow and the flow is determined only to the resolution of the friction terms. The solver
     then chases round-off: a startup from rest reached t = 3e-4 s in minutes of wall time. With
     der(m_flow) present the flows are states with a well-conditioned 0.73 s time constant and
     start at zero because they are zero.

     Setting momentumDynamics also switches on TRANSFORM's momentum-flux term
     (use_I_flows = momentumDynamics <> SteadyState), which Phase 15 measured at 0.7 Pa against a
     35 kPa total - it changes no steady result. */

<h4>Test description (paper Section 4.1)</h4>
<p>The reactor is held at about 100 W and 908 K, so thermal feedback is negligible, and both
the fuel and the coolant pump are initially at rest. The fuel pump is started at
<code>t_null</code> and brings the flow to its rated value in about 10 s. Throughout the
transient the flux servo controller moves the control rods to keep the reactor critical, so
the measured rod reactivity is exactly the reactivity change caused by the fuel flow.</p>

<h4>How the model reproduces it</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>use_servoControl = true</code> holds the neutron population constant and reports the
required rod reactivity through paper Eq. 7, available as
<code>msre.rho_CR_pcm</code>.</li>
<li>A null transient of <code>t_null</code> seconds with the pump stopped builds the stagnant
precursor distribution: precursors accumulate in the core and there are none in the loop, which
is the initial condition the paper describes. 600 s is about eleven half-lives of the
longest-lived group, so the distribution is fully converged. <code>Beta_eff</code> is then
frozen at the stagnant value, which must come out as the total delayed fraction 0.006781.</li>
<li>The pump <b>speed</b> is prescribed, not the flow; the flow follows from the loop momentum
balance, so the transit time that drives the whole effect is a model result.</li>
</ul>

<p>The oscillations in the rod reactivity are the physical signature the paper emphasises: the
long-lived precursors created in the core before the pump started re-enter the core once per
system transit time, so the reactivity oscillates with a period equal to that transit time and
the oscillation decays away. Because the control rod motion is not modelled explicitly, the
reactivity overshoot seen in the experiment around 15 s does not appear here either, exactly
as the paper notes for MARS.</p>

<p><code>drho_analytic_pcm</code> evaluates paper Eq. 8 at the transit times reported in the
paper and should agree with the asymptotic value of <code>msre.rho_CR_pcm</code> to within a
few pcm.</p>

<h4>Sensitivity cases of the paper</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faster pump (moment of inertia halved): set <code>tau_startup = 1.7</code>.</li>
<li>Extended core volume: increase <code>msre.geometry.V_upperPlenum</code> and shorten
<code>msre.geometry.L_downcomer</code> so that <code>V_downcomer</code> falls by the same
amount (it is derived from the vessel annulus and is no longer settable directly), which
lengthens the core transit
time and shortens the loop transit time and, as the paper shows, reduces the reactivity
loss.</li>
</ul>
