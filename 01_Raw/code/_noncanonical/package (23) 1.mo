  /* The pump transients solve the momentum balance DYNAMICALLY, unlike the steady models.

     Two reasons, and the first is physical. The loop's effective inertia length is
     sum(L_i/A_i) = 1314 1/m, dominated by the three 5-inch pipes, so accelerating the loop from
     rest to 166.5 kg/s under the pump's 300 kPa takes m_flow*L_eff/dp = 0.73 s. That is not
     negligible against the 4 s shaft time constant of a 10 s startup, and an algebraic momentum
     balance discards it entirely.

     The second is that a stagnant loop is DEGENERATE under an algebraic momentum balance. With
     the pump off, isothermal and elevation closed, sum(dp) = 0 is satisfied identically at zero
     flow and the flow is determined only to the resolution of the friction terms. The solver
     then chases round-off: a startup from rest reached t = 3e-4 s in minutes of wall time. With
     der(m_flow) present the flows are states with a well-conditioned 0.73 s time constant and
     start at zero because they are zero.

     Setting momentumDynamics also switches on TRANSFORM's momentum-flux term
     (use_I_flows = momentumDynamics <> SteadyState), which Phase 15 measured at 0.7 Pa against a
     35 kPa total - it changes no steady result. */

  /* Starting from rest is not a stylistic choice. TRANSFORM filters every K form loss through a
     first-order lag whose output is initialized to zero unconditionally
     (PartialMomentumBalance.firstOrder_dps_K, y_start = 0, T = 0.01 s), so initializing at rated
     flow states that the loop carries 168 kg/s while three quarters of its resistance does not
     exist. That is not a steady state: the loop initializes some 55 % high and the missing
     216 kPa then has to appear within one 0.01 s time constant against an algebraic momentum
     balance, which the integrator does not survive. At zero flow the form losses genuinely are
     zero, so y_start = 0 is correct there and the null transient brings the loop up to rated
     before the trip - which is also what the experiment describes. See
     MSRE.Verification.Loop_Hydraulics. */

<h4>Test description (paper Section 4.2)</h4>
<p>The inverse of the startup test. The reactor is again at about 100 W and 908 K, the fuel
pump is running at the rated 168 kg/s, and at <code>t_null</code> it is tripped. As the flow
decays the precursors spend longer inside the core, the effective delayed neutron fraction
recovers towards the static value and positive reactivity is inserted, which the control rods
must cancel.</p>

<h4>How the model reproduces it</h4>
<ul>
<li>The null transient runs at rated flow, so the frozen <code>Beta_eff</code> is the
<i>circulating</i> value. With the transit times of this model that is about 0.00452, roughly
two thirds of the static 0.006781, and the difference is the 227 pcm of drift reactivity.</li>
<li>The prescribed speed law <code>N = N_0/(1 + t/tau_coast)</code> is the exact solution of
the pump angular momentum equation <code>J*dw/dt = -tau_hyd*(w/w_n)^2</code>, so
<code>tau_coast</code> is the model's counterpart of the pump moment of inertia that the paper
tunes: <code>tau_coast = J*omega_nominal/tau_hydraulic_nominal</code>. Halving the moment of
inertia means halving <code>tau_coast</code>.</li>
<li>The flow itself is not prescribed; it follows from the loop momentum balance with the idle
pump acting as a form loss.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What to plot, and what the paper reports</h4>
<table border=\"1\">
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Paper figure</th><th>Paper result</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>msre.m_flow_fuel_norm</code> vs <code>msre.t_rel</code></td><td>Fig. 7</td>
<td>estimated data available to 20 s, standard deviation 1.4%</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>msre.rho_CR_pcm</code> vs <code>msre.t_rel</code></td><td>Fig. 8</td>
<td>good agreement up to 70 s; the equilibrium value is not reached within the measurement
window because the long-lived groups are slow</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The sign convention here is that <code>rho_CR_pcm</code> is the reactivity the rods add. It
starts at zero and becomes negative as the returning precursors insert positive reactivity, and
its magnitude approaches the same drift reactivity that the startup test builds up. Running
both tests and checking that the two asymptotes are equal and opposite is a useful consistency
check on the precursor transport solution.</p>

<p>The paper notes that halving the moment of inertia improved the startup test but degraded
the coastdown, and concludes that the hydraulic and friction torques would have to be adjusted
as well. The same limitation applies to the single time constant used here.</p>
